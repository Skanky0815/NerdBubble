          "plaintext": "Birmingham Cross-City release date update:\nAfter reviewing the most recent build of the route overnight, we need a little\nmore time to iron out a couple of lighting issues that the team have identified.\n\nWhilst we are confident in providing a fix, as it is so close to release it does\nmean we need a couple of extra days to implement and test it ahead of submitting\nit to the respective platforms.\n\nAs a result, we will be delaying the release of the route by a couple of days,\nand moving the preview stream to next week.\n\nThis means:\n\n * Pre-order remains live today on Steam (and is available now\n   [https://store.steampowered.com/app/1998976/])\n * Release will move from Tuesday 15th to Thursday 17th November\n * The live stream preview for the route will now be Tuesday, 15th November, at\n   17:00 UTC\n\nThanks for your understanding. We want to ensure the finished product is as good\nas it can be, and the extra time will allow us to sort the issues we’ve seen\ntoday.\n\nTimetable Deep Dive\nIn this article, much like the Southeastern Highspeed article before it, we\nshall be taking you through all the fun nuances and layers you can look forward\nto on your Cross-City journey!\n\nBefore we continue, we’re happy to say that once again, the following is true\nfor ALL PLATFORMS, there are no missing or altered services on “Gen 8” consoles.\nSo, if you own the add-ons required to activate certain layers, you can play\nthem regardless! If you’d rather wait and see what the timetable contains when\nit releases, then please consider this your spoiler alert.\n\nThe Team\n\nThe best timetables come from collaborative efforts and the same rings true\nhere. Firstly, we have Daisy from West Midlands Trains, who you may have read\nabout in our last Roadmap, she has been instrumental in research and reference\nfor this route, including the timetable. Then on the Dovetail side we have the\nstalwart Michaela and Joe; Michaela taking the lead on implementing the\ntimetable and Joe offering his assistance, and lastly myself (James) for\nsuggesting different layers and ideas, as well as playing it and offering\nfeedback during the creation process.\n\nWest Midlands Railway Services\n\nAfter the learnings taken in previous releases, and how current timetables are\nstill showing the effect of the pandemic, the first decision was easy – to use\nthe 2019 Working Timetable. This helps show the Cross-City line in its full\ncapacity, with more variety in service patterns, for example:\n\n * 2 Trains per hour between Lichfield Trent Valley and Bromsgrove\n * 2 Trains per hour between Lichfield Trent Valley and Redditch\n * 1 Train per hour between Four Oaks and Bromsgrove\n * 1 Train per hour between Four Oaks and Redditch\n * At certain times of day, mainly around rush hour, services also\n   originate/terminate at Longbridge, Lichfield City and Birmingham New Street\n * Several rush hour services also skip select stations\n * Empty Coaching Stock moves to reposition trains where they are needed\n\nThis means that throughout the day, you can expect on average to see a train\nevery 10 minutes in each direction between Four Oaks and Barnt Green, as well as\nexperience the line in shift patterns – stick with a single unit for a few hours\nand you will have soon visited the entire network. All in all, the Class 323 has\n223 services on the Cross-City Line.\n\nIt takes a little over 15 formations to fulfil this timetable, performing an\naverage of 15 services each. One formation represents 6-car services, while the\nrest represent 3-car services - the bulk of the traffic as per the 2019\ntimetable.\n\n\n\nHere we see 323211, twinned with 323201, rounding the curve outside Aston bound\nfor Four Oaks on 2U06, passing 323214 in the process (above). After performing\nthis service from Redditch, the pair will turn tail and embark on 2O14 for\nBromsgrove (below).\n\n\n\n\n\nAmidst very different weather, 323211 is seen again powering carefully out of\nKings Norton on its northbound journey across the city (above). The next station\nis Bournville… is anyone feeling peckish? (below).\n\n\n\nRail Head Treatment Train\n\nThe first layer of note and it’s a busy one! At Kings Norton on the southern\nhalf of the route, just south of Bournville, lies an engineering depot which has\nthe prime purpose of housing RHTT equipment during the leaf fall season. With\nthe Rail Head Treatment Train having not long released for Train Sim World 3, it\nfelt only natural to include some seasonal services for Cross-City.\n\nOperating between September and November, RHTT circuits make their way around\nthe route, departing from the depot and running both north and south before\nreturning later in the day.\n\n\n\nAs the sun rises on an Autumnal Cross-City Line, Class 66s prepare for RHTT\nduties at Kings Norton Depot, while the early morning rush is already well\nunderway (above). Later on, clouds have set in over Birmingham, giving 3J01, an\nearly afternoon RHTT service bound for Birmingham New Street, an overcast\nhorizon as it passes through Selly Oak (below).\n\n\n\nRemember, thanks to loco decoupling in Train Sim World 3, and despite the RHTT\nbeing for Southeastern Highspeed, this is not a requirement. If you don’t own\nTrain Sim World 3 and pick up the Birmingham Cross-City Starter Pack, you can\nalso pick up the RHTT and learn how to drive it on the Training Center, before\nembarking on these leaf-blasting services.\n\nFreight Services\n\nBeing such a dense commuter network, the Cross-City Line is not one which is\nbursting at the seams with freight, especially not in the core section of the\ncity itself. Instead, much of the freight is focused on the lower portion of the\nroute, between Bromsgrove and Kings Norton. This section, while short, does\nhowever offer the unique challenge to tackle the famed Lickey Incline, both the\nsteep climb and the hair-raising descent. Similarly, much of the freight is kept\nto quieter hours on the line.\n\nThe core of the freight timetable is based on the BR Class 66, as featured in\nSoutheastern Highspeed, however other Class 66s can substitute into this so you\ncan pick which one you want to drive. The JNAs are also used on occasional AI\nservices on the West Coast Main Line at Lichfield Trent Valley. Remember, if you\nalready own Southeastern High Speed in Train Sim World 2, when you buy Train Sim\nWorld 3 you get the extended version for free – the same rings true if you\nkick-off your journey with the Birmingham Cross-City Starter Pack.\n\nOwners of Great Western Express will find they have 3 additional freight\nservices in the timetable; a container service using the FKAs before the sun\nrises, and a pair of HKA aggregate services under the shadow of night. The FKAs\nare also used for more occasional West Coast Main Line AI traffic.\n\nNext up is Tees Valley Line, using the BBA wagons, a trio of steel-laden\nservices await the daring rise and fall of the Lickey. Lastly, if you also own\nthe Class 31, the included PCA wagons are used on another 3 cement services.\n\n\n\nAs dawn sets in, 6V82, which is onward bound for Avonmouth, makes its way south\nafter joining the Cross-City Line at Kings Norton (above). Meanwhile, its slip\nand slide for Corby-bound 6M96, which embarks on the climb out of Bromsgrove\n(below). Even with the double-headed power, all we can say is, good luck!\n\n\n\nTractor-on-Tour\n\nFor the railtour in this timetable, we decided to go diesel, and wanted to put\nthe Class 37 to good use. Set around dawn, and limited to summer months, owners\nof Tees Valley Line and Northern Trans-Pennine can look forward to a\ndouble-headed treatment of tractors, running from Lichfield City all the way\ndown to Bromsgrove, with a return timed for late at night. As per usual, all\nlayers are inspired by real-world events, photographic research was instrumental\nin piecing together this timetable – so if you happened to get some Cross-City\nClass 37 haulage in June 2019, this may be familiar to you!\n\n\n\nA duo of diesels wakes up the locals of Shenstone, powering their way south on\n1Z80 (above). Picturesque scenes of canal parallel running await on the other\nside of New Street. A busy day on the Cross-City Line later, and the pair are\nnow making their return under low light, easing through University station\n(below). Could you focus on studying when your Uni is the only one in the UK\nwith its own railway station? We for sure could not!\n\n\n\nHigh Speed on the Move\n\nThe last layer of note focuses on a series of rather unique moves which happened\nquite a lot during 2019. With the retirement of HST trainsets on mainline GWR\nservices, and their planned introduction on secondary duties in the Western\nRegion, many Class 43s and Mk3 coaches were sent to and from their depot in the\nwest to Doncaster Works in South Yorkshire for refurbishment and maintenance.\nTheir path necessitated traversal of the Lickey Incline.\n\nIf you own Great Western Express and Northern Trans-Pennine (more on that in a\nminute), you can enjoy a handful of services showcasing these HST refurbishment\nmoves. Sent on an ad-hoc basis, they were rarely ever travelling as complete\nformations...\n\n\n\nPower cars aplenty on the Cross-City Line! Back-to-back on 0E23, this HST could\nnot be much shorter, and should make easy work of the Lickey Incline (above).\nAnd now for something really cool, 3 is a magic number as this most unique\nformation reaches the top of the incline (below) – featuring a triple line-up of\nHST power cars, 2 Mk3s, a barrier Mk1 coach and a trailing 47 to boot!\n\n\n\nClosing Words\n\nIt goes without saying that no two routes are the same, and based on location,\nfleet and real-world frequency, timetables will vary in-game just as much as the\nroutes themselves. It is fun for us to work on such diverse experiences, they\neach offer something so unique which makes hopping from route to route that much\nmore enjoyable and exciting, and once again it has been a pleasure to deliver\nanother UK timetable in Train Sim World 3’s first route add-on.\n\nSo, there we have it, it might not be the 4000-word behemoth that the\nSoutheastern deep dive was, but we hope this serves as a nice insight into the\ntimetable and what you can look forward to when Birmingham Cross-City Line\narrives on November 17th – be sure to let us know what you intend to drive\nfirst!\n\nWe’re also very keen to see what journeys and experiences you make for yourself\non Scenario Planner. What will you attempt the Lickey Incline in? And if you’re\nfeeling creative, don’t forget that West Midlands Railway is an operator logo\navailable in the Livery Designer, so get out your orange and purple paint\nbuckets and go to town!\n\nYou can pre-order [https://store.steampowered.com/app/1998976/]  Train Sim World\n3: Birmingham Cross-City Line: Lichfield - Bromsgrove & Redditch on Steam, and\nif you want to see it in action, tune in to our Railfan TV preview stream\nTuesday November 15th at a NEW streaming time of 1700 UTC, we look forward to\nseeing you there!\n\n\n\nBirmingham Cross-City Line: Lichfield - Bromsgrove & Redditch arrives for Train\nSim World 3 on the 17th of November for Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation\n4, PlayStation 5, Epic Games Store, and Steam!\n\nPre-Order on Steam or add to your Wishlist!\n[https://store.steampowered.com/app/1998976/Train_Sim_World_3_Birmingham_CrossCity_Line_Lichfield__Bromsgrove__Redditch_Route_AddOn/]\n\nJoin the Railfan TV team on Twitch [https://twitch.tv/dovetailgames], YouTube\n[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvdG4CxeXdKlw-p99eyn4WQ], or Facebook\n[https://www.facebook.com/trainsimworld]. on the 15th of November at 1700 UTC to\ncatch your first proper glimpse of Birmingham Cross-City Line\n\nFind out more about the Birmingham Cross-City Line: Lichfield - Bromsgrove &\nRedditch, Train Sim World 3, and more by following @trainsimworld on Twitter\n[https://twitter.com/trainsimworld], Instagram\n[https://www.instagram.com/trainsim/], Facebook\n[https://www.facebook.com/trainsimworld], YouTube [https://bit.ly/TSW-YouTube], \nTwitch [https://bit.ly/TSW-Twitch], and TikTok\n[https://www.tiktok.com/@trainsimworldofficial].\n\n  [https://forums.dovetailgames.com/threads/thread-awaiting-details.61434/]",
